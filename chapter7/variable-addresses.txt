7.5 Variable Addresses and High-Level Languages

"This section describes how you can organize your variable declarations to produce efficient code."

many CPUs have whats called "addressing modes" that allow the CPU to use different types of addressing. like how a immediate constant gets accessed in memory
more efficient than others

constants -> worry about the value
variables -> must consider the address in memory where the compiler places them

"the 80x86 CPU supports three address sizes: 0 bit, 8 bit, and 32 bit. The 80x86 uses 0-bit displacements for register-indirect addressing modes."
