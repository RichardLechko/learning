# 7.2 What Is a Variable?

Understanding what constitutes a variable is fundamental to writing efficient code and understanding how different programming constructs behave at the machine level. This section examines the attributes that define variables and the processes that associate these attributes with program objects.

## 7.2.1 Variable Attributes

Every variable in a program possesses several distinct attributes that determine how it behaves and how the system manages it:

### The Five Core Attributes

1. **Name** - The identifier used in source code
2. **Memory Address** - The location in memory where data is stored
3. **Size** - The number of bytes required for storage
4. **Runtime Value** - The actual data stored at any given moment
5. **Data Type** - Determines interpretation and allowed operations

### Attribute Examples

```c
int temperature = 72;
```

For this variable:
- **Name**: `temperature`
- **Memory Address**: `0x7fff5fbff6ac` (example address)
- **Size**: 4 bytes (typical for `int`)
- **Runtime Value**: 72
- **Data Type**: `int` (32-bit signed integer)

### Attributes Are Not Universal

Not all program objects possess all attributes:

**Constants may lack memory addresses:**
```c
#define MAX_SIZE 100
// MAX_SIZE has no memory address - it's replaced during preprocessing
```

**Anonymous objects may lack names:**
```c
*(ptr + 5) = 42;  // The memory location has no source-code name
```

**Temporary values may be short-lived:**
```assembly
# Result of (a + b) exists only in register
movl -8(%rbp), %eax   # Load a
addl -4(%rbp), %eax   # Add b (result temporarily in %eax)
movl %eax, -12(%rbp)  # Store to another variable
```

## 7.2.2 Binding

**Binding** is the fundamental process of associating an attribute with a program object. Understanding when and how binding occurs is crucial for understanding program behavior and performance.

### Types of Binding Operations

**Value Binding:**
```c
int count = 10;        // Binds value 10 to variable count
count = count + 1;     // Rebinds count to value 11
```

**Address Binding:**
```c
int x;                 // Compiler binds a memory address to x
int *ptr = &x;         // Binds address of x as value of ptr
```

**Type Binding:**
```c
int number;            // Binds int type to identifier 'number'
double ratio;          // Binds double type to identifier 'ratio'
```

### When Binding Occurs

Binding can happen at different times during the program lifecycle:

1. **Language Design Time** - Built-in types, operators
2. **Compile Time** - Variable types, constant values
3. **Link Time** - External function addresses
4. **Load Time** - Final memory addresses for static data
5. **Runtime** - Dynamic allocations, variable values

## 7.2.3 Static Objects

**Static objects** have their key attributes bound before program execution begins. This early binding provides predictability and performance benefits.

### Characteristics of Static Objects

**Compile-Time Binding:**
```c
const int MAX_USERS = 1000;  // Value bound at compile time
static int user_count = 0;   // Address bound at compile/link time
```

**Examples in Assembly:**
```assembly
# const int MAX_USERS = 1000 becomes:
movl $1000, %eax            # Value 1000 embedded in instruction

# static int user_count access:
movl user_count(%rip), %eax # Address resolved before execution
```

### Categories of Static Objects

**Compile-Time Constants:**
- Literal values: `42`, `"Hello"`, `3.14159`
- `#define` macros: `#define PI 3.14159`
- `const` expressions: `const int SIZE = 10 * 10;`

**Static Variables:**
- Global variables: `int global_counter;`
- Static locals: `static int call_count = 0;`
- String literals: `char *msg = "Error";`

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: No runtime allocation overhead
- **Predictability**: Addresses known at link time
- **Persistence**: Values retained throughout program execution

## 7.2.4 Dynamic Objects

**Dynamic objects** have attributes bound during program execution. This flexibility comes with performance costs but enables powerful programming patterns.

### Runtime Binding Examples

**Local Variable Allocation:**
```c
void function() {
    int local_var;  // Address bound when function called
    local_var = 42; // Value bound during execution
}
```

**Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
```c
int *array = malloc(size * sizeof(int));  // Address bound at runtime
array[0] = 100;                          // Value bound at runtime
```

**Assembly View of Dynamic Binding:**
```assembly
# Local variable allocation
subq $16, %rsp              # Allocate stack space (address binding)
movl $42, -4(%rbp)          # Store value (value binding)

# Dynamic allocation
movl %eax, %edi             # Size argument
call malloc@PLT             # Runtime address binding
```

### Categories of Dynamic Objects

**Automatic Variables:**
- Local variables in functions
- Function parameters
- Temporary computation results

**Heap Objects:**
- `malloc`/`free` in C
- `new`/`delete` in C++
- Garbage-collected objects in managed languages

**Characteristics:**
- **Flexibility**: Size and lifetime controlled by program logic
- **Overhead**: Runtime allocation/deallocation costs
- **Complexity**: Manual memory management in some languages

## 7.2.5 Scope

**Scope** determines the region of program text where a variable's name is bound to a particular object. Scope is primarily a compile-time concept that enables name reuse and encapsulation.

### Scope Types and Examples

**Global Scope:**
```c
int global_var = 100;  // Visible throughout the file

void function1() {
    global_var = 200;  // Can access global_var
}

void function2() {
    printf("%d", global_var);  // Same global_var
}
```

**Function Scope:**
```c
void function() {
    int local_var = 50;     // Only visible within function
    {
        int block_var = 25; // Only visible within block
        local_var = 75;     // Can access function-scope variable
    }
    // block_var not accessible here
}
```

**Name Shadowing:**
```c
int x = 100;           // Global x

void function() {
    int x = 200;       // Local x shadows global x
    printf("%d", x);   // Prints 200, not 100
    
    {
        int x = 300;   // Block x shadows function x
        printf("%d", x);  // Prints 300
    }
    printf("%d", x);   // Prints 200 again
}
```

### Scope Implementation

**Assembly View:**
```assembly
# Global variable access
movl global_var(%rip), %eax

# Local variable access  
movl -8(%rbp), %eax     # Different address space

# Same name, different scopes use different addresses
```

### Modern Scope Features

**Static Analysis:**
Modern compilers perform sophisticated scope analysis:
- Dead code elimination
- Unused variable warnings
- Lifetime optimization

**Link-Time Optimization:**
- Cross-module scope analysis
- Inlining across translation units
- Global optimization opportunities

## 7.2.6 Lifetime

**Lifetime** determines how long a variable exists in memory - from allocation to deallocation. Unlike scope (compile-time), lifetime is a runtime concept.

### Lifetime Categories

**Static Lifetime:**
```c
static int permanent = 100;  // Lives for entire program execution
int global = 200;            // Also lives for entire program
```

**Automatic Lifetime:**
```c
void function() {
    int temp = 50;  // Created when function called
                    // Destroyed when function returns
}
```

**Dynamic Lifetime:**
```c
int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));  // Created by malloc call
*ptr = 100;
free(ptr);                       // Destroyed by free call
```

### Lifetime vs Scope Distinction

These concepts are independent:

```c
int* create_array() {
    static int static_local = 0;     // Function scope, static lifetime
    int *dynamic = malloc(100);      // Function scope, dynamic lifetime
    
    static_local++;                  // Persists between calls
    return dynamic;                  // Outlives function scope
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Static local**: Limited scope but permanent lifetime
- **Returned pointer**: Scope ends but lifetime continues
- **Different management**: Static vs manual vs automatic

### Memory Leaks and Lifetime

**Proper Lifetime Management:**
```c
void good_example() {
    int *data = malloc(100);     // Begin lifetime
    // ... use data ...
    free(data);                  // End lifetime
}
```

**Memory Leak:**
```c
void bad_example() {
    int *data = malloc(100);     // Begin lifetime
    // ... use data ...
    return;                      // Lifetime never explicitly ended!
}
```

## 7.2.7 Variable Definition Synthesis

**Formal Definition**: A variable is an object that can have its value attribute bound dynamically during program execution. The ability to change the value at runtime distinguishes variables from constants.

### Variable vs Non-Variable Objects

**Variables** (value can change):
```c
int counter = 0;               // Can be modified
static double average;         // Can be computed and stored
char buffer[100];              // Contents can change
```

**Non-Variables** (value cannot change):
```c
const int MAX_SIZE = 100;      // Value fixed at compile time
#define PI 3.14159             // Replaced by preprocessor
enum { RED, GREEN, BLUE };     // Values fixed at compile time
```

### The Value Binding Test

The crucial test for determining if something is a variable:

1. **Can the value attribute be changed after initial binding?**
   - Yes → Variable
   - No → Constant or literal

2. **Is the value determined at runtime?**
   - Yes → Dynamic variable
   - No → Static constant or literal

### Modern Implications

**Compiler Optimizations:**
```c
int x = 10;
const int y = 10;

// Compiler may:
// - Store x in memory (variable)
// - Replace y with literal 10 (constant)
```

**Thread Safety:**
- Variables require synchronization in multi-threaded code
- Constants are inherently thread-safe
- Static variables shared between threads need protection

**Performance Considerations:**
- Variable access may require memory reads
- Constant values can be embedded in instructions
- Lifetime affects memory usage patterns

Understanding these fundamental concepts provides the foundation for comprehending how different storage classes behave and why certain programming patterns are more efficient than others.
