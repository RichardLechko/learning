Go is similar to C.

Go inherited its expression syntax, control flow statements, basic data types, call by value parameter passing, and pointers from C.

Go also has C's emphasis on programs being efficient and work smoothely with the OS and machine code.

Go 2nd biggest influencer is Pascal. then follows Modula-2 which inspired packages. then came Oberon / Oberon-2 / Object Oberon.

Tony Hoare's 1978 paper on the foundations of concurrency created the "communicating sequential processes" (CSP) which then created a bunch of little research languages that then helped create Go.
