Chapter 2.1 Names

In Go, anything being named has to begin with a letter or an underscore and may have anything else follow it.

"The case of the first letter of a name determines its visibility across package boundaries." what??

capital letter (like "A") -> exported and can be used outside of its own package (think Printf in the fmt package)

Go programmers tend to use camel case.
