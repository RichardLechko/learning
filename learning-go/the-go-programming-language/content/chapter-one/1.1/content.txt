Chapter 1.1 Tutorial

Go is a compiled language. Source Program -> Machine Code

You can run "go build [filename].go" to compile a file then run "./[filename]" to get the output. This creates an executable binary file.

Go code is organized into packages. "A package consists of one or more .go source files in a single directory that define what the package does."

Each .go file has to start with a package declaration, like "package main". the main package is a standalone executable program not a library.
similarly, the main function is where the execution of the program happens.

you can only import what you need, if there are unnecessary imports the program wont compile.

a function declaration starts with func, the name of the function, a parameter list, a result list, and the body of a function.

Go does not require semicolons at the end of statements or declarations.
