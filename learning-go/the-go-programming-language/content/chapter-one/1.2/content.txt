Chapter 1.2 Command-Line Arguments

The "os" package helps interacting with the OS independet of what platform you are on.

you pass arguments in a command line via the variable "Args" in the os package.
os.Args is a slice of strings, which is a dynamically sized sequence "s" of array elements and individual elements can be accessed as "s[i]" and
a contiguous subsequence as "s[m:n]".
os.Args[0] = the name of the command, then os.Args[1-n] are just the arguments that were passed in.
os.Args[1:] = all the arguments passed through

it is standard to have comment(s) describing the package/source file before the package declaration

uninitializied numbers are 0 and strings are ""

j = i++ and j = --i is illegal.

Go only has for loops. the for loops dont use paranthesis for the conditions and the opening brace must be on the same line as the for.

for {
    // this is an infinite while loop
}
