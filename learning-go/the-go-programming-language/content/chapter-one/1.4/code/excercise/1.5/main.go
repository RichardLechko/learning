// Exercise 1.5: Change the Lissajous programâ€™s color palette to green on black, for added authenticity.
// To create the web color #RRGGBB, use color.RGBA{0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB, 0xff} -
// where each pair of hexadecimal digits represents the intensity of the red, green, or blue component of the pixel.
