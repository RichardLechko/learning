this goes over how to recreate the Unix "uniq" command to find duplicating lines in an input file

a map in Go holds key/value pairs and constant-time operations to store, retrieve, or test for an item in the set.

Printf helps formatting numbers:

%d -> decimal integer
%x or %o -> integer in hexadecimal, octal, or binary
%b -> represents the value in binary
%f or %g -> floating point numbers
%e -> scientific notation 3.141593e+00
%t -> boolean values (true or false)
%c -> rune (Unicode code point)
%s -> string
%q -> quoted string
%v -> any value in natural format
%T -> type of any value
%% -> literal percent sign (no operand)

\n -> new line
\t -> tab

you can declare functions and methods in any order
